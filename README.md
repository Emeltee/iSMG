This project makes use of the libGDX framework 
(http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com), and conforms to the program structure it
prescribes. For a better understanding of how to work with the code, reading
through the libGDX docs is recommended.

We the authors release all original code and art resources into the public
domain. This encompasses all Java sources under the “my-gdx-game/src” directory
and the sprites gathered here:

Use them in any way you see fit, we won't mind or ask for anything in return.
Credit would be appreciated, but isn't required.
